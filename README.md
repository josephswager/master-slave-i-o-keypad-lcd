# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###
Test serial communication between Arduino boards.

### How do I get set up? ###
You just need to have 2 Arduino boards, its IDE installed and follow the fritz diagrams provided. 

There will be three Fritz graphs: 
	1. How to setup the keypad for input in the Master board.
	2. How to connect the master to the slave board. 
	3. How to use an LCD for output on slave board.


### Contribution guidelines ###
Unit tests are most welcome.
Also, any AVR or straight C code would be nice since we would like to get away from the Arduino Libs.
